# MHC Frontend Developer Test using Redux & Redux-Thunk (by Hendri Agustino)

This project is a coding test / developer test which I did for MHC. This is a frontend web application which consists of communication with a live database.

**Project Scope** :
- Design and develop a web application that will facilitate the online management of doctors, clinics and network. 
- All of which requires CRUD menus that have responsible and appropriate validations (e.g. names should not have numbers, etc.)
- There should be an admin login (you can use the User APIs to create via Postman – note when creating password – its bcrypt 10 cycles – and login via your frontend). 
- Admins will then land on a dashboard of a few numbers, e.g. Total Number of Providers, Total Number of Personnel, Total Number of Doctors. On the left, there should be a navigation pane with these headers – Dashboard (with the numbers), Personnel Manager, Provider Manager, Facilities Manager. 
- The admin can then view a list of Personnel in the Personnel Manager and delete / view more / create more. Same goes for all the other managers.
